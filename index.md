# About me

I'm a guy who studied Electronics, working as a Software Engineer,
being interested in personal development and trying to be an artist, designer,
musician, sportsman, cook, linux lover, open source supporter, gamer,
mechanical keyboard geek and overall project maniac in his spare time.

But most of the time, I'm just a normal guy.
